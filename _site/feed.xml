The article was first published on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.svds.com/customer-journey-set-success/&quot;&gt;SVDS Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bradaallen.github.io/customer-journey-success-part-1/&quot;&gt;introductory post&lt;/a&gt;, we walked through some examples of how SVDS has seen data capabilities determine the success of customer journey initiatives for our clients. In this post, we offer guidance on the data-related initiatives that you can start today to begin fostering closer ties with your customers—regardless of where you currently are in your specific state of development.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;customer-journeys-allow-for-a-holistic-experience&quot;&gt;Customer journeys allow for a holistic experience&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A senior marketer’s ability to find and create valuable experiences for customers has grown dramatically in recent years. Beyond the traditional responsibilities of brand and creative management, senior marketers (such as CMOs, Brand Managers, and Product Marketing Managers) now use analytics to track customer interactions, measure the quality of engagement, and determine the effectiveness of an enormous range of different marketing tactics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marketers often map out a &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2015/11/competing-on-customer-journeys&quot;&gt;“customer journey”&lt;/a&gt; in order to manage successful engagements. The customer journey is the complete sum of experiences that your customers go through when interacting with your company and brand—mapping out these interactions gives you a holistic view of how customers engage with your company. While many marketers focus on developing positive interactions, a customer journey is a plan that focuses on how a series of engagements can generate momentum from awareness, to sale, to ongoing loyalty and advocacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;creating-customer-journey-opportunities-with-data&quot;&gt;Creating customer journey opportunities with data&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At SVDS, we have seen leaders use data to drive more useful customer engagements—first and foremost by recognizing their need to embrace change. There is a big shift taking place, and that shift will become the new normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should be trying to learn quickly, and fail fast. Companies that are able make the best use of their data and infrastructure earlier than their competition are at an advantage—both with regard to increased customer loyalty and improvements in new product development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bradaallen.github.io/customer-journey-success-part-1/&quot;&gt;November 2015 Harvard Business Review article&lt;/a&gt; on the customer journey, the authors stated that, “Best practitioners aim not just to improve the existing journey but to expand it, adding useful steps or features.” As mentioned in the examples earlier in this post, we have seen the same trend: clients who can harness their data to create effective customer experiences often make further investments toward developing their capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are data-related initiatives that you can begin pursuing today to develop stronger relationships with your customers. Make an honest assessment of where you stand now, and find yourself in the sections below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;if-you-are-starting-from-scratch&quot;&gt;If you are starting from scratch:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Common Challenges&lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Redefining decision-making based on insights&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Identifying single points of ownership&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Common Solutions&lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Focus on top-down buy-in. Without recognition from leadership, data initiatives will struggle to get relevance with business users and may be piecemeal efforts, diminishing the value of investment.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;if-you-are-performing-early-project-identification&quot;&gt;If you are performing early project identification:&lt;/h4&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Mapping out customer journey initiatives&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Identifying single points of ownership&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Common Solutions&lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Get alignment on the full picture. It is important to be able to articulate the “full view” of the customer experience as it has a large effect on decision making. For example, only tracking successful interactions would lead to very different conclusions than understanding users that “turn away.”&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Plan for iteration. It often takes time to understand where your map does and does not match your customers’ realities.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Start small. Change can be incremental—look for low-hanging fruit.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Data integration&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Common Solutions&lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Prioritize data collection in tandem with journey mapping. In instrumentation, it is important to know what behaviors you can collect directly from customers and what behaviors you have to infer based on their actions. This influences what additional data sources you include to support decisions you make for the business.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Seek to reuse and extend data services. Developing known, validated, and consistent data assets for your business increases their utility and dramatically improves trust in the developed insights across the organization.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Common Challenges&lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Personalization and automation&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Common Solutions&lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Enable advanced analytics. Optimize for automation to create feedback loops and self-learning capabilities that make it easy to identify and capitalize on growth opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;customer-journeys-allow-for-a-holistic-experience&quot;&gt;Customer journeys allow for a holistic experience&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A senior marketer’s ability to find and create valuable experiences for customers has grown dramatically in recent years. Beyond the traditional responsibilities of brand and creative management, senior marketers (such as CMOs, Brand Managers, and Product Marketing Managers) now use analytics to track customer interactions, measure the quality of engagement, and determine the effectiveness of an enormous range of different marketing tactics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marketers often map out a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forrester.com/Customer-Journey&quot;&gt;“customer journey”&lt;/a&gt; in order to manage successful engagements. The customer journey is the complete sum of experiences that your customers go through when interacting with your company and brand—mapping out these interactions gives you a holistic view of how customers engage with your company. While many marketers focus on developing positive interactions, a customer journey is a plan that focuses on how a series of engagements can generate momentum from awareness, to sale, to ongoing loyalty and advocacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2014/11/new-report-salesforce-marketing-cloud-linkedin-state-marketing-leadership.html&quot;&gt;Salesforce report&lt;/a&gt;, nearly all senior level marketers agree that a comprehensive journey map is absolutely critical or very important to their business. At the same time, the report mentions that this map has largely been an aspiration for marketers—in part due to siloed business teams and a disjointed view of customer data, only 29% of enterprise companies would rate themselves as very effective or effective at creating a cohesive journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Senior marketers should take the responsibility for this challenge head on; to be successful in creating a useful map, you will also need to be the leader of the technical and analytical development of their teams. You should have an intuition for how data can enhance, track, and articulate the customer experience—as this intuition creates new possibilities for the type of relationships companies can have with their customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this first post, we’ll walk through some examples of how we have seen data capabilities determine the success of customer journey initiatives for our clients. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://bradaallen.github.io/customer-journey-success-part-2/&quot;&gt;subsequent posts&lt;/a&gt;, we’ll also offer guidance on the data-related initiatives that you can start today to begin fostering closer ties with your customers—regardless of where you currently are in your specific state of development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-can-your-data-do-for-you&quot;&gt;What can your data do for you?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve seen data play various roles in creating strong customer engagements. Here’s a look at just a few.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;optimize-against-competing-outcomes-using-effectively-stitched-data-social-gaming&quot;&gt;Optimize against competing outcomes using effectively stitched data (Social Gaming)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many businesses, legacy and heterogeneous systems are a challenge for creating an integrated customer experience—the data is often structured with a narrow lens on a specific product or domain. We worked with a social gaming company facing this challenge: they wanted to create a cohesive customer experience across all their games by extending the preferential treatment that loyal customers receive for their favorite games to new games on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a per-game basis, our client was technically sophisticated—they could build out events, correlate performance with targeted marketing strategies, and articulate the effectiveness of different campaigns. However, this sophistication fell apart at the organization-wide level. After several acquisitions and the use of third party licensing for games, the company found itself with a broken analytical architecture—each game optimized for itself, but there was a lot of opportunity in optimizing across the business. By supporting the integration of different data from different silos, the new architecture enabled the company to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Increase customer satisfaction by rewarding loyalty.&lt;/em&gt; By not being able to establish a single view of their customers, our client was continually losing opportunities to tailor experiences for their customers. For example, high-paying customers that had “preferred” status for certain games would return to being “unknown” when they started playing new games. By helping the client carry customer status across games, players will have greater satisfaction and loyalty.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Improve game development by understanding interaction patterns.&lt;/em&gt; Some of the most important metrics in gaming—e.g., alliances and teaming—are challenging to measure. Breaking down silos allowed the client to utilize novel sources of data, like gaming chats, to articulate a “web of influence” and its role in engagement and profitability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By reframing the customer journey as an experience that transcends individual games—and developing a supporting data architecture—our client was able to both develop an engine for growth and improve profitability on an individual basis, by both reducing the acquisition cost (UAC) of customers and increasing their lifetime value (LTV).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;redefine-your-brand-and-product-suite-with-a-more-modern-architecture-digital-entertainment&quot;&gt;Redefine your brand and product suite with a more modern architecture (Digital Entertainment)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a look at the data sources you’re using in your marketing efforts and you may find some unexpected insights. For example, is there untapped value in your existing customer relationships? A digital entertainment company wanted to develop a modern database architecture that would allow them to understand user consumption at both a customer and population-level—at a microsecond granularity.
Redesigning the client’s architecture to identify and articulate the customer’s consumption patterns ultimately gave the client vastly more usable data about their customers, which led to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;New customer offerings.&lt;/em&gt; Our client used these new capabilities to develop more effective cross-selling opportunities and to develop products that provide guidance to content providers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Improved strategic decision making.&lt;/em&gt; This view of consumption informed large strategic bets for the organization—for example, the decision to give away existing products for free in return for increased engagement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The client had always had tremendous potential to understand customer engagement and consumption patterns—they were a portal for millions of users. However, their existing platform was limited by its underlying technology and a myopic view of the role of data. In their original product offering, the collected data was not necessarily perceived to have inherent value. We find this type of oversight to be common for marketers beginning to build analytics within their teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: This concept of “instrumentation”—the process of logging and tracking customer interactions—is important when creating an engagement plan. Instrumentation creates a more nuanced understanding of what customers find valuable about your products and services. For our client, this instrumentation influenced their entire business: from feature development, to sales, to pricing, and even to marketing copy about the efficacy of their existing product suite. Instrumentation is so important, in fact, that it is something we at SVDS specifically assess when considering the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.svds.com/understanding-your-data-maturity/&quot;&gt;data maturity of a business&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;update-back-office-processes-to-redefine-customer-expectations-national-retailer&quot;&gt;Update back-office processes to redefine customer expectations (National Retailer)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work that begins in the marketing department often extends to influence other parts of a business. In one example, we worked with a traditional brick and mortar retail client that was in the process of developing their digital presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As their customers began to spend more time purchasing items online, our client realized that they would need new capabilities to support new types of interactions—for example, granularity in tracking inventory. When creating its online presence, our client found itself frequently selling under-stocked items from the website, and then had to follow them up with costly gift card apologies to disappointed customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We helped the client gain an understanding of their inventory baseline and establish a real-time view of changes in supply and demand. This allowed the business as a whole to establish new customer relationships and a leaner efficiency:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Customer interaction with the brand.&lt;/em&gt; E-commerce has developed some great features to incent purchasing behavior—we have all experienced messages like, “There are only 3 items left in stock!” or “Order by 11:59pm Tuesday to get by Christmas.” Our client’s new modern inventory infrastructure allowed them to create similar features, increasing trust and confidence in the brand.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reduced working capital.&lt;/em&gt; In the past, a granular level of detail—across stores, channels, and partners (e.g., third party sellers)—was not required from legacy operations. In developing a new system, our client was able to serve items that were stocked-out in their web distribution centers from stores in close proximity to the buyers. This allowed our client to reduce their buffer stock and protect against obsolescence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our retail client, marketing’s strategic influence and digital leadership forced growth in other parts of the business that benefited customers and improved the company’s competitive position.&lt;/p&gt;

The article was first published on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.svds.com/value-centered-data-maturity/&quot;&gt;SVDS Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;success-with-data-involves-managing-strengths-and-weaknesses&quot;&gt;Success with data involves managing strengths and weaknesses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The great data rush is well and truly under way. Across virtually every industry, companies large and small are committing serious money to standing up their data infrastructure, beefing up capabilities, and hunting for the value hidden in their data—but often without a clear plan. No wonder that many of the business leaders we speak with suspect their initiatives are underperforming. The complaint we hear most frequently, regardless of industry, is that technology investments aren’t generating the expected returns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.svds.com/first-steps-strategy/&quot;&gt;previous post on data maturity&lt;/a&gt;, we discussed a company that was just embarking on a transformation: launching a new services business and building data capabilities to support that business. But what if you’re not starting from the beginning? What if you’ve already been embracing new technology, conducting pilots, and launching new analytical platforms? Recently, we were working with a Fortune 500 industrial company in the midst of developing software services to improve product R&amp;amp;D and enrich the customer experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their goal was to &lt;a href=&quot;https://svds.com/building-a-data-driven-culture/&quot;&gt;use data to empower decision makers&lt;/a&gt; across every part of the organization to make robust, data-driven choices. The company had great talent, technical vision, and infrastructure. &lt;strong&gt;Still, they weren’t generating the progress they would have liked at a rate they would have expected. What was wrong?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sometimes-the-business-can-hold-good-technology-behind&quot;&gt;Sometimes, the business can hold good technology behind&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working with our client to articulate their overall data maturity shined a light on areas requiring attention to get the most of their technology investments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Missing links between projects and metrics:&lt;/em&gt; The initiative’s overall success was being measured by a single metric that they could only begin tracking in 2020—at the completion of the transformation. This led to significant uncertainty within project teams building new capabilities and platforms. Many teams were unsure where their analytical work fit in the big into the larger efforts and, more importantly, whether they were contributing to the overall success of the transformation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lack of cross-functional teams:&lt;/em&gt; The analytical infrastructure built by the engineering team was impressive, but was sorely underutilized. The data scientists had not been trained to use it and did not know how to access it. We heard from an analytics manager: “Seventy percent of my team’s time is spent on writing UDFs and Pig scripts to access data!” Creating teams that facilitated collaboration between engineers and data scientists was an opportunity for quick productivity gains with expensive talent.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Siloed business functions:&lt;/em&gt; Teams felt a lack of clear objectives that stemmed from communication and information sharing issues with other teams. For example, one team integral to product development described their view of the future as “a dusty window.” Business units on the consumption side of application development experienced very uneven usage of analytical tools. Strengthening these partnerships was crucial as the overarching project’s success relied specifically on strong analytical capabilities throughout the entire organization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In working together, we helped the industrial company link their data and analytical capabilities with their ultimate business objectives, allowing them to create the right metrics to truly understand their progress. We helped them improve their devops capabilities and better integrate their engineering and data science teams. Collectively, this helped them break down technical and organizational siloes that were hampering progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding the uneven maturity of their capabilities across people, process, and systems gave them the answers they needed to the question on everyone’s minds: How can we see real results faster? A view of the current state of maturity along with a clear roadmap for success creates a baseline and a way to measure progress.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Knowing what to do with it is what matters most.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Understanding Your Data Maturity</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/understanding-data-maturity/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Understanding Your Data Maturity" /><published>2018-05-01T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2018-05-01T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/understanding-data-maturity</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/understanding-data-maturity/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was co-authored along with Scott Kurth, based on our experience at SVDS.

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-effective-are-you-with-your-capabilities&quot;&gt;How &lt;em&gt;effective&lt;/em&gt; are you with your capabilities?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Businesses today are experiencing rapid change, inside and outside of Silicon Valley. Even coffee isn’t immune—just last year, Starbucks crossed the threshold of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-30/starbucks-takes-its-pioneering-mobile-phone-app-to-grande-level&quot;&gt;more than 20% of transactions being done in their mobile application&lt;/a&gt;. Data is the currency of &lt;a href=&quot;https://svds.com/optimizing-your-digital-strategy/&quot;&gt;digital transformation&lt;/a&gt;, and data capabilities are the battlefield influencing market share and profitability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No two situations are the same, but at SVDS we have found one truism: making a data transformation successful requires much more than simply getting the technology right. Across a variety of industries and operations, we consistently find the influence of systems and people to be deciding factors. This is one of the reasons why we developed our &lt;a href=&quot;https://svds.com/what-are-you-doing-with-your-data/&quot;&gt;Data Maturity Model&lt;/a&gt; — a tool for understanding how well your data capabilities create value for your business, across people, process, and systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;data-maturity-in-practice&quot;&gt;Data maturity in practice&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data maturity is a useful tool for measuring the progress being made against your transformation. Recently, we were working with a multi-billion dollar industrial device company that was just beginning their Internet of Things (IoT) transformation: integrating software services with their physical devices. The vision was set and small experiments were being run throughout the organization—but the real work of building had not yet begun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company’s overarching strategy made a lot of sense—building a higher-margin services business from the key position their devices play in their customers’ workflows. We were asked to help them develop a data strategy and accompanying architecture to make that possible. Fundamentally, they needed a plan to use analytics and device data to create new services their clients would value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this company certainly had major technology investments in its future, some of the most urgent things necessary for this transformation to be successful had little to do with technology:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;New incentives to change required:&lt;/em&gt; Like many established product companies, the organization was structured around distinct, mature product lines. With very different P&amp;amp;Ls and incentives, we were told: “Careers are made within the business units, not the company.” There was an inherent skepticism for investing in unproven growth, especially if the effort was performed by a centralized function.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lack of experience with data rights:&lt;/em&gt; At this time, a very small percentage of overall revenue was produced through software. To sidestep questions of license management, the default behavior was to “make stuff free so that we do not have to create licenses.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;New customer relationships (and approach to product development):&lt;/em&gt; Getting the most value from device data meant integrating it with some of the customers’ own data sources to provide greater context to end users. This meant expanding or revisiting customer relationships to embrace data sharing, requiring updates to processes in sales management (i.e., around channel or partnership agreements) and overarching application strategies (e.g., creating standards and cultivating ISV ecosystems).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In working together, we helped the industrial product company identify solutions for incentivizing technical investment. We identified policies required around data ownership, custody, and consent as a precursor to becoming an integrator and reseller in the supply chain of data services. We helped them update their architecture to support these services. It is not uncommon for an SVDS maturity assessment to reveal a broad set of opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, our client was equipped with a broader perspective on what they needed to launch their software business and a roadmap to build all aspects of their data capabilities, ensuring that their transformation would be more successful. A clear roadmap helped them fill in the gaps between here and there, illuminating the concrete steps they needed to achieve their vision. Although transformation does not have a fixed end point, milestones are important—change should be incremental enough that the organization can see progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it won’t give you a full picture of your organization, these exercises are a good starting point to help you gain a better sense of your company’s data maturity and spark productive exchanges with your colleagues. Is your organization using data just for generating reports or focusing on use cases in mission-critical areas? Or is it putting data first in every business activity? Knowing where you stand will increase your understanding of your organization’s potential, provide a baseline for measuring progress, and give you a framework for thinking about your data operations and how they might compare with the competition’s and your industry’s as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">First steps in a data strategy.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Digital Economy Part III: Technology requires deeper integration into our work lives.</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/digital-economy-part-3/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Digital Economy Part III: Technology requires deeper integration into our work lives.

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Living in Silicon Valley, it is difficult to not get caught up in techno-optimism. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://reports.weforum.org/digital-transformation-of-industries/&quot;&gt;World Economic Forum&lt;/a&gt;, many &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mckinsey.com/industries/high-tech/our-insights/digital-america-a-tale-of-the-haves-and-have-mores&quot;&gt;McKinsey reports&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kurzweilai.net/ray-kurzweil-biography&quot;&gt;Ray Kurzweil&lt;/a&gt; frequently remind us of the “unique time” we live in and the benefits of increasingly digital tools - the “4th Industrial Revolution.” It is easy to get caught up in the narrative that, collectively, we are building a service-oriented future, one of unprecedented disruption and progress. Is there any reason to call this into question?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is “yes.” As a simple statistic, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/cea_2015_erp.pdf&quot;&gt;2015 Economic Report of the President&lt;/a&gt; noted that if economic productivity growth had continued to grow at its 1948–1973 rate, the average household income in the United States would be $30,000 higher today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology has undoubtedly provided tremendous benefits to our society. With increased globalization in trade, innovation in information and communication technologies (ICT) is the second defining macroeconomic trend of the late 20th Century and early 21st Century. Together, they have raised hundreds of millions out of poverty, have removed countless information asymmetries (redefining the role of intermediaries and brokers in value chains), and have changed how groups organize, communicate, and exert political influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But despite their influence, these two sources of growth have not been able to provide comparable growth to historical innovations and trends. Furthermore, looking forward, there are many reasons to believe that this “quest for growth” may be even more difficult in the next few decades than it has been over the past 40 years. Our faith in technology, while directionally correct, may mask the amount of work required to create the future we want for ourselves and our children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unclear of what to make of these apparent paradoxes, I spent time researching economic literature, policy papers, and investment recommendations to understand the impact of digital technologies on the economic growth of the United States. My general conclusion was that digital’s anticipated effect on growth may not be enough to overcome weaknesses in a few common markers of a healthy, burgeoning economy: broad innovation, strong labor trends, and general competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the United States, companies leading digital transformations are winning the battle for market share and profit growth; some (but not many) are reshaping entire industries to their own advantage. Workers with the most sophisticated digital skills are in such high demand that they command wages far above the national average. Meanwhile, there is a growing opportunity cost for the organizations and individuals that fall behind—and too many are falling behind.  After this research, I was left with five conclusions for improving future opportunity:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Due to today’s market structures, digital skills most benefit incumbent firms. Economic shifts will be slow without large shocks to competition.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Greater investments should be made in basic science R&amp;amp;D, to identify future growth and diversify areas of productivity in the economy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A key differentiation for digital technology is the knowledge of how to effectively apply technology. Therefore, job skills and retraining are a particularly important area of public-private partnerships.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As the value of synthesized data grows, greater attention will need to be given to the administration of data security and privacy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For those marginalized by these disruptions in society, greater guardrails and supports may need to be put in place - e.g., reform in active labor policies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a later exercise, my hope is to identify caucuses, task forces, and organizations that are working on initiatives aligned with these causes. The research and additional detail that led to these conclusions can be found in a few supporting articles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Part I: We are in a time of slow productivity and strong incumbents.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Part II: Aging &amp;amp; unproven learning models are headwinds to growth.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Part III: Technology requires deeper integration into our work lives.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;project-summary&quot;&gt;Project Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project is the capstone for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120&quot;&gt;“Introduction to Machine Learning”&lt;/a&gt; course in the Udacity Machine Learning Engineering nanodegree. It involves using the “Enron corpus”—a body of information that was made publicly available following the Enron scandal in the early 2000s. It has all salary information and email communications. It is rare, as most companies keep these communications private. For CS folks, it is particularly valuable—it is a dataset that reveals common networks, patterns, and communications. This is a useful basis for developing and testing new models about how people interact in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of project is to use a dataset built from the corpus to create a model that identifies “Persons of Interest” (POIs). A POI is someone whom we believe is a strong candidate for having committed fraudulent activities—for example, Jeffrey Skilling and Kenneth Lay. The dataset includes characteristics about the different individuals at Enron—for example, their known interactions with POIs (how many emails did they send or receive), the portion of their total compensation that was a bonus, etc. Doing some cursory analysis, we have 21 characteristics/columns we could use as “features” in our model. There are 146 individuals in the dataset, of whom 128 are NOT POIs, and 18 are POIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/skilling.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;This guy is definitely a &quot;POI&quot;.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The model we are trying to create is an algorithm that will comb the dataset to predict the probability of whether an individual is a POI. Therefore, it is important that we build this algorithm with accurate underlying data. It is most likely that we will not need all 21 columns as “features” in the model, as some will have more predictive capabilities than others, and some may have no predictive capabilities at all. Finally, we may want to create new columns using outside data, or the provided dataset. We would do this if we expect the new columns to be more predictive of POIs than the information we currently have in its existing representation. Here are a few changes I made:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I threw away the “email_address” field as there isn’t meaningful information between the different values to help us identify a POI.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I threw away the ‘TRAVEL AGENCY IN THE PARK’ and ‘TOTAL’ rows as outliers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I created several new “ratio” fields: the percentage of emails to or from a POI, the percentage of compensation that came in bonus, salary, and restricted stock.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;feature-selection-and-tuning&quot;&gt;Feature Selection and Tuning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NaN values in the dataset are a blend of string and nan values. I converted all NaN values to a numpy nan (np.nan) value, and then converted the values to an outlier value (I used -0.42, which is close to (but not quite) the “Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything.” This allows the dataframe to be processed by classification algorithms that can’t take N/A values, such as Random Forest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ran a Random Forest classification quickly to see what my preliminary values were—the answer was not very good. I had “mild” predictive capabilities for people who are NOT POIs, and 0% accuracy/recall/precision for predicting POIs. Part of the reason for this is the imbalance between the two classes (noted earlier, ~85% of the list are not POIs) and the model is trying to predict for the larger class. Fortunately, my colleague Tom Fawcett has written about this (see: &lt;a href=&quot;https://svds.com/learning-imbalanced-classes/&quot;&gt;Learning from Unbalanced Classes&lt;/a&gt;). I began building ROC curves and precision-recall curves to understand performance for different tuning parameters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To determine the right features and tuning parameters, I built a Pipeline using SelectKBest and GridSearchCV together. The pipeline applies the first step by choosing the best k features and transforms the input data to have only these features. After transformation, this is then fit with different estimators. GridSearchCV helps to tune the “number of features to be selected” and the hyperparameter of the estimator, by selecting the parameters that give the best score on validation data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sample code for testing SVMs:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;kbest = SelectKBest(f_classif)&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pipeline = Pipeline([('kbest', kbest), ('svm', SVC())])&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;grid_search_svm = GridSearchCV(pipeline, {'kbest__k': [1,2,3,4], 'svm__C': [1, 2, 3, 4], 
                                      'svm__kernel': ['linear', 'poly', 'rbf', 'sigmoid'] })&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;grid_search_svm.fit(features.values, labels['poi'].values)&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;labels_pred_svm = grid_search_svm.predict(features_test)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;print classification_report(labels_test, labels_pred_svm)&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;print confusion_matrix(labels_test, labels_pred_svm)&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;print grid_search_svm.best_params_&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;print plot_ROC_curve(grid_search_svm, features.values, labels['poi'].values)&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;print plot_PR_curve(grid_search_svm, features.values, labels['poi'].values)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;selecting-an-algorithm-and-performance&quot;&gt;Selecting an Algorithm and Performance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tested 3 different types of algorithms on the dataset with the pipeline method described above:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Decision Trees:&lt;/em&gt; A decision tree can be thought of as a flowchart that classifies samples based on feature performance. They are very useful in practice as it is easy to determine provenance—I can articulate how and why an algorithm makes a decision. This is helpful in industries like financial services, in which there are regulations against favoring or biasing against specific groups. The performance for POI prediction can be found below:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/decision-trees.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Decision Tree performance.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Random Forests:&lt;/em&gt; A “random forest” is an ensemble model of different decision trees. Roughly speaking, random forests create several decision trees and then “blend” their results to create a newly predicted outcome. When it comes to accuracy, they are very useful in practice. At the same time, there is a greater challenge in understanding “how” predictions are made. Also, since multiple trees are created and blended, there is often a significant runtime associated with Random Forests, which needs to be accounted for in data products and analytic workflows. The performance for POI prediction can be found below:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/random-forest.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Random Forest performance.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gaussian NB:&lt;/em&gt; Naive Bayes classifiers treat different features as independent of one another. For example, a fruit may be considered to be an apple if it is red, round, and about 10 cm in diameter. A naive Bayes classifier considers each of these features to contribute independently to the probability that this fruit is an apple, regardless of any possible correlations between the color, roundness, and diameter features. It has been found useful in text retrieval and medical diagnoses. The performance for POI prediction can be found below:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Gaussian.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Gaussian NB performance.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These calculations are derived from each model’s confusion matrix, which is a table outlining how different predictions performed against a holdout set of data with known labels. If we treat the predictions as probabilities instead of hard labels (for example, an individual is “54% likely” to be a POI as opposed to only 0% or 100%), we can create an ROC chart as a metric for performance: an explanation of how to use ROC curves &lt;a href=&quot;http://gim.unmc.edu/dxtests/roc2.htm&quot;&gt;can be found here&lt;/a&gt;. Below is the ROC chart for Decision Trees:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/ROC-curve.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code I used split the data into 3 “folds”, each of which has different performance—the “mean ROC” is the final measure when deciding the performance of the algorithm. The greater the area indicates stronger predictiveness. There is no absolute threshold for determining good performance—one needs to consider the context surrounding the decision being made.
I found that Decision Trees performed the best, as measured by Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Precision is a measure of the number of identified True Positives divided by the total number of Positive test results (including False Positives). FPs are known as Type I Error.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Recall is the number of identified True Positives divided by the total number of actual Positive samples (including False Negatives). FNs are known as Type II Error.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A F1 Score is a measure of accuracy, calculated as the harmonic mean of Precision and Recall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When looking at these scores, I was more focused on the ability to predict “1s” than the overall measures. The value 1 represents a POI. Since the data is skewed towards non-POIs (80%+ of the set), the overall numbers give the impression that the models are more highly predictive than what would be representative of their intended use. Similarly, since the goal of the activity is to identify POIs, we might be comfortable with a lower Precision measurement (increased FPs) if it provides a higher Recall (minimized FNs). Similar biases are present in medical testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an important note, all of my measurements regarding performance are calculated using a “holdout” set or a “fold” that is independent of the data upon which the model is constructed. This is referred to as “validation.” Validation is important because we are trying to generate models that have inference—some predictive capability—on a general population. We want to make sure that our models perform more effectively (much more effectively) than random chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do this, we use a set of data that the model &lt;em&gt;has never seen&lt;/em&gt; and may not be entirely representative of the distribution of data upon which the model was constructed. Articulating the model’s performance using these metrics helps ensure that we are not “overfitting” the data—models that are highly predictive of the datasets on which they were trained, but perform poorly in general practice. Here is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2015/08/preserving-validity-in-adaptive-data-analysis/&quot;&gt;a great article&lt;/a&gt; from IBM Research on preserving validity in analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a fun project that helped hammer home some of the key concepts of data preparation and model selection. Much of my prior training in data science was done in R, and I wanted a guided introduction to scikit-learn, numpy, and pandas. It is amazing how transferable the approach and libraries are for the two languages—at the same time, there are funny anachronisms for how scikit-learn takes data from pandas dataframes vs. numpy arrays.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Figuring out what is different about Jeff Skilling.</summary></entry></feed>
