*This article was written in 2017 during my time at SVDS. The article was first published on the [SVDS Blog][0].*

*In the [introductory post][1], we walked through some examples of how SVDS has seen data capabilities determine the success of customer journey initiatives for our clients. In this post, we offer guidance on the data-related initiatives that you can start today to begin fostering closer ties with your customers—regardless of where you currently are in your specific state of development.*

•	DS:
o	Programming & Architecture: 
	Ability to write tested, functional, modular code.
	Ability to work with git, in a gitflow environment.
	Can work in single- and distributed-machine environments with guidance.
o	ML:
	Understand the requirements of a full end-to-end ML solution (ie, target definition, ETL, KPI definition, training vs. scoring, model maintenance tooling)
	Has experience in 2 of 3: classification, regression, optimization. 
o	Consulting:
	Developing skills in workplanning, time management, written and verbal communication (pyramid principle – “tailoring the message”)
	Developing skills in knowing when to involve leadership to “unblock” vs. solving independently
•	SDS:
o	Programming & Architecture:
	Can perform code reviews.
	Can set up and manage the integrity of a codebase (refactor and redesign as needed, separate out cross-cutting functionality)
	Can identify the required solution architecture (infrastructure, programming languages req., storage patterns). – SDS2
o	ML:
	Can design a full E2E ML solution and offer alternatives based on resources, timeline, and client need.
o	Consulting:
	Focus is on module ownership – the ability to iterate a solution’s design to fit the client’s needs, plus the ability to design an E2E workplan for the module.
	Can begin to design consumable output (ie, feeding into campaign mgmt. system vs. Tableau vs. API vs. application)


•	Overall (LDS+): Greater appreciation required for the benefits of clean code. Timelines and Gamma experience leads to “tactical programming” instead of “strategic programming.” We prioritize on quick output over the design of clean systems. This leads to bugs and complexity that make changes more difficult – this is where projects get burned.
•	Overall (LDS+): Better understanding up front of the technical tools required for a solution. Resources aren’t fungible and too much risk if the full team is implementing a new technology for the first time. 
•	Overall (LDS+): Agile Product Management. Designing full solutions early and adding functionality/complexity over time.
•	SDS: 
o	Wide variety in programming and engineering skillset. Many have gaps for what I would consider a high performing DS. Makes it difficult to work with them and focus on the logic of the problem.
o	Need greater “big picture focus” on how the solution will be owned and maintained by the client. In the solution design, lots of small complexity/optimizations that appear interesting over the course of a project, but end up running out of time, isn’t handed over well, or is not maintainable. Results orientation should be towards “what works 18mo after we leave.” 
	^^ translates into better workplanning, more curiosity around client dynamics (eg, req. process redesign, teaming, skills)
o	Need greater focus on the “so what” – being able to understand how we are creating value for the client and designing systems that prove the incremental gain
•	DS: 
o	Focus should be on gaining a mental map for what skills are required to be a successful DS. Can be myopic in going very deep in a few areas, with large gaps in other parts. This pattern (and rewarding it) may be a cause for the unevenness in the SDS cohort.


•	All Martin Fowler / XP programming books on writing clean code and continuous delivery (I can send a list).
