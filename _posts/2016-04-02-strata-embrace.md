Last week, I got to give [a talk][1] at [Strata] [2] with my buddy Linus about our former employer, [Embrace][3] . We spoke to a crowd of ~80 about Embrace Angel, an R&D effort by Embrace to add sensors to their warming devices - measuring temperature, heartbeat, pulse oximetry, et. al. It was fun to discuss two of our big passions: social change and nascent technology. 

Linus was part of original team when Embrace was founded at [Stanford’s d.school][4] and worked as the company’s first COO. I moved there a few years later and worked as a Product Manager for the 2nd product, the Embrace Care (an at-home infant warmer).
