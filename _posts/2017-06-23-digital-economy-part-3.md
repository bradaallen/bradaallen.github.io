*These articles are part of exploration that started in late 2015 and early 2016. It was a confusing time: autonomous vehicles and Boston Dynamics were frequently in the news and OpenAI was just formed to make sure that the "march towards AGI was safe." UBI was actively being discussed by Sam Altman and Ray Kurzweil was promoting 10x / exponential thinking. At the same time, economists like Robert Gordon were arguing that we were actually living in a time of low progress.*

*I tried to develop my own perspective on what was happening, with key conclusions presented [at this link][0]. Greater detail supporting other conclusions can be found in [Part I][1] and [Part II][2].*
