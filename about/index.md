I'm a Pennsylvanian dropped in San Francisco. I moved to the West Coast a few years ago for a Stanford MBA and spent much of my time building things - or at least trying to :).

I believe machine learning has the potential to change the way we do business, and am fortunate get to explore this transformation daily with BCG Gamma, [BCG's Advanced Analytics and Data Science][1] team.

Making effective use of ML is a hard challenge - it's new technology, new techniques, and asks us to change our habits and interactions. **My hope is to use this site in three ways:**
* To **share what I've learned in leading ML projects** (in the event it might be useful for others)
* To **work through ideas around effective reskilling** and growing ML capabilities in organizations (particularly via government and public-private initiatives)
* To **document my own ongoing practice** and learning - there is always more to know. :)

Because of this, "Perpetually Learning" seemed like the right name for the blog.

Outside of work, a few things that are important to me: supporting my friends and family, education (and educational equity), live concerts (or watching - The Last Waltz!), soccer, whiskey, and the Rockies. Please feel free to reach out at any time. I would love to hear from you.
