I'm a Pennsylvanian dropped in San Francisco. I moved to the West Coast a few years ago for a Stanford MBA and spent much of my time building things - or at least trying to :).

I'm fascinated by the changing role of information in products and society, and get to explore this transformation daily with BCG Gamma, [BCG's Advanced Analytics and Data Science][1] team. My hope is to use this site for practice and to share some things I've learned (thus, "Perpetually Learning").

I'm passionate about the development and scaling of technologies that provide broad social benefit - including prior work at [Peloton Technology][2] (automating freight transportation), [Aclima][3] (air quality sensing), and [Embrace][4] (developing world healthcare).

In prior lives, I was a Bain consultant and Teach For America corps member. I love soccer, education (and educational equity), ramen, whiskey, the Rockies, The Last Waltz, and whiskey. Please feel free to reach out at any time!
